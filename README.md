<h1>Mini-Chess AI Battle:</h1>

Welcome to the Mini-Chess AI Battle repository! <br><br>
This university project (2023) aims to help students have a better understand of basic AI by developing your own AI player for a mini-chess variant using Minimin / Minimax or other algorithms. Compete with the baselines and conquer the top rank of the class!!

<h3>ðŸ“– About the Project</h3>
Mini-Chess Variant: A simplified version of chess, perfect for experimenting with AI strategies while keeping things manageable.<br>
<h3>ðŸŒŸ Key Features </h3>
Strategic Depth: Leverage Minimax to evaluate potential moves and decide the best course of action.<br>
Learning-Focused: Strengthen the understanding of game theory, decision trees, and AI development in a fun(?), hands-on way.<br>
<h3>ðŸŽ¯ Goals</h3>
Develop an AI that can play mini-chess autonomously, in which the AI should choose the best action in each round. <br>
Learn by Doing: Gain experience with algorithms like Minimax in a practical, engaging setting.<br><br>
